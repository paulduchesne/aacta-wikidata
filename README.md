# AFI/AACTA Awards to Wikidata.

Notebook for import of `Australian Film Institute` (1958 - 2010) and `Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts` (2011 - ongoing) awards for feature film into Wikidata.

Original attempts at "cold" string matching from source data introduced inaccurate entity matching, so rebuilt using tables from Wikipedia.

Still many absent data points due to name variations, intention to run secondary validation notebook.
