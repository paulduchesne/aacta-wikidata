# AFI/AACTA Awards -> Wikidata
AACTA/AFI data import into Wikidata.

Notebook for import of Australian Film Institute (1958-2010) and Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (2011- ) awards for feature film.

Original attempts at "flat" string matching based only on source data from the AACTA website introduced issues with accurate entity matching, rebuilt using the same data which can already be found in Wikipedia and the wikipedia -> Wikidata link easy to traverse.

Still a number of absent data points owing to variations in spelling, intention to run a validation pass to fix up remaining items.
